# Jokes from Reddit

This is my first project ever working with Javascript.

It is really simple, it gets the r/jokes/new or
r/jokes/hot page in JSON, then displays it an a (in my opinion)
easier to read format.I have also made some options with some functions
and global variables.

With the design, I tried to go for minimality, and tried to loosely follow
Google's material design guidelines.

2015.10.29. I implemented and fixed everything I wanted to.
Also huge thanks for Reddit user [/r/deckstir](https://www.reddit.com/user/deckstir) for the suggestions and help.

##This project is finished.
